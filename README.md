# Aware Breath
#### Introduction
It is an Android application that help in improving focus. My attention was diverted while I was studying, which was a major issue for me. Concentrating on my studies was quite difficult.

I made the decision to look for the problem's core cause. I discovered that it was caused by the rise in dopamine levels that occurs when we watch reels.
I therefore developed app which helps to restores the dopamine level to normal so that we can concentrate on our studies.

**Application functions** as a tool that makes it simple to focus on **breathing** and is the best technique to restore dopamine levels to normal.
